## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Arnold-Kakas/paddleR")

library(paddleR)
```

## üì¶ About paddleR

This R package provides a robust interface to the Paddle API, enabling
developers, analysts, and product teams to interact with Paddle‚Äôs
billing and subscription platform directly from R.

The package allows you to:

- Create, retrieve, and update customers
- Generate authentication tokens for Paddle.js checkout flows
- Query customer lists with filters and pagination
- Retrieve subscription details, including status and history
- Manage products
- Manage invoices
- Many more

The package supports two modes of operation:

- Live mode (default): connects to the production Paddle API
- Sandbox mode: connects to the Paddle sandbox environment for testing

You can toggle modes using:

``` r
set_paddle_mode("sandbox")  # or "live"
```

All API endpoints automatically adjust their base URL and authentication
based on the selected mode.

## üîê API Key Configuration

To authenticate with the Paddle API, you must set your API key(s) as
environment variables. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use a single key

Set PADDLE_KEY to the appropriate key for your current mode.

``` r
Sys.setenv(PADDLE_KEY = "your-live-or-sandbox-key") # or use .Renviron file
```

## Option 2 (Recommended): Use separate keys for live and sandbox

Set both PADDLE_KEY_LIVE and PADDLE_KEY_SANDBOX, and the package will
automatically use the correct one based on the selected mode.

``` r
Sys.setenv(PADDLE_KEY_LIVE = "your-live-key")
Sys.setenv(PADDLE_KEY_SANDBOX = "your-sandbox-key")
```

API keys must have the appropriate permissions based on the Paddle
endpoint you are accessing. Refer to the official [Paddle API
docs](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/overview) for required
scopes.
